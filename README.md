# Ecommerce-Sales-Dashboard
I'm excited to present my first-ever Power BI dashboard built for analyzing eCommerce sales data. This interactive report brings together various metrics to give a comprehensive overview of sales performance, customer behavior, and category-level insights. Creating this dashboard helped me understand the core concepts of Power BI, including data modeling, DAX functions, and effective visual storytelling.

üîç Key Highlights from the Dashboard:
1. Overall Sales Performance
Total Sales Amount: ‚Çπ438K

Total Profit Earned: ‚Çπ37K

Total Quantity Sold: 5,615 units

Average Order Value (AOV): ‚Çπ121K

These KPIs give a snapshot of the business performance and help gauge profitability and customer purchasing power.

2. Profit Trend Over Time
One of the most insightful visuals in this dashboard is the "Sum of Profit by Month" bar chart. It clearly shows that:

January and February were the most profitable months, both exceeding ‚Çπ9K in profit.

A significant dip occurred in June, showing a negative profit.

December again peaked, indicating strong year-end sales.

This kind of time-based analysis helps in identifying seasonal trends and planning marketing strategies accordingly.

3. Sales Breakdown by Region
The "Sum of Amount by State" chart indicates Maharashtra as the top contributor to sales, followed by Madhya Pradesh. Smaller sales were recorded in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. This can guide future targeted campaigns or delivery expansions in high-performing states.

4. Customer-Based Analysis
The "Sum of Amount by Customer Name" bar graph shows individual customer contributions, with "Harivansh" being the highest spender, followed by "Madhav" and "Madan Mohan." This data helps in identifying loyal customers who could be offered exclusive deals or loyalty programs.

5. Payment Mode Preferences
The donut chart for "Sum of Quantity by Payment Mode" reveals:

Cash on Delivery (COD) is the most popular (44%)

Followed by UPI (21%), Debit Card (13%), and Credit Card (12%)

This indicates a heavy reliance on COD, which could affect return rates and processing times. Promoting prepaid methods might improve cash flow.

6. Product Category Insights
Clothing dominates the quantity sold (63%), followed by Electronics (21%) and Furniture (17%).

From a profit standpoint, Printers and Bookcases lead the charts, suggesting they are high-margin products.

Categories like Accessories and Tables generate relatively lower profit, but could be scaled with better promotions.

7. Sub-Category Profitability
This bar chart offers a focused view of what products are driving profit:

Printers and Bookcases are clear winners.

Sarees, Accessories, and Tables also contribute moderately.

Understanding sub-category profit margins can help in inventory planning and marketing efforts.

üß† Learnings:
Creating this dashboard taught me the importance of not just visualizing data, but telling a story through it. I explored DAX for creating measures like total profit, average order value, and custom calculations. Additionally, I learned how different visuals can serve different purposes‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs spotting trends, comparing segments, or understanding customer behavior.

This project has been a great starting point in my data journey, and I look forward to building more dashboards with deeper insights and interactivity.
